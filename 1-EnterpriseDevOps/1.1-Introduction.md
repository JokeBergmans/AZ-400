## [What is DevOps?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-devops/2-what-is-devops)


> DevOps stands for **Development** and **Operations**. It strives to replace **siloed** dev and ops teams by 
> - Creating **multidisciplinary teams**
> - Using **agile planning**
> - Using **continuous integration** & **continuous delivery**

![Devops cycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/introduction-to-devops/media/devops-cycle-98924900-a8ba6dc4.png)

### Software development cycle

> OODA stands for **Observe**, **Orient**, **Decide**, **Act**. This is the software development cycle.

- **Observe** business, market, used needs,...
- **Orient** possible options, experiment, ...
- **Decide** on solution
- **Act** by delivering

> Becoming **data-informed** is important to **fail-fast**:
> Pivoting ASAP on failure allows more time for positive deployments

 - 1/3 of deployments -> **positive results**
 - 1/3 of deployments -> **no difference**
 - 1/3 of deployments -> **negative results**

> Feedback from each cycle should be factual, actionable data => **validated learning**

> More frequent deployments = more experiment = more validated learning => **value of improvement**

## [Expore the DevOps Journey](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-devops/3-explore-devops-journey)

### Continuous integration
> Continuous integration is the automation of **building** and **testing** of code

### Continuous delivery
> Continuous delivery is the automation of **deployments** to testing and production **environments**

### Version control

> Version control (like Git) enables effective cooperation and communication

### Agile planning

> Agile planning helps
> - **Plan & isolate** work into sprints
> - **Manage** team capacity
> - **Adapt** fast to changing business needs

### Monitoring & logging

> Monitoring **application health** & **customer usage** helps validate strategies

### Cloud infrastructure

> **Infrastructure as a Service** & **Platform as a Service** help gain productivity

### Infrastructure as Code

> Infrastructure as Code enables **automation** & **validation** of creation/teardown of environments

### Microservices

> Microservice architecture enables **scalability** & **efficiency** by using reusable services

### Containers

> Containers are more **lightweight** than VMs and allow **easy configuration**
